This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Overview

This is a collection of demos and protoypes I made Fall of 2023 to learn about making an app that utilizes AI. Much of what I've learned with these has carried over to making [BuddyGenAI](https://github.com/parsehex/BuddyGenAI), an app/game to make virtual buddies to talk with.

I may/will probably circle back to clean up this project in the future. I believe I updated to use the standalone [py-ai-server](https://github.com/parsehex/py-ai-server) but the project might still be setup to use `./py_api/`.
