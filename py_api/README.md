# py-api server

## Overview

This is an api server to support this `ai-experiments` collection of demos.

Instead of finding and using yet another third-party server (and probably multiple of them) to serve an api I'm just going to make a light-and-easy api that does what I need.

This may be a learning experience but hopefully it grows into something standalone. For now there's lots to do.

## Background + IDK

When I start `ai-experiments`, I also start up at least Oobabooga and possibly Automatic1111 or even XTTS too. Having all 3 together would be great, and I think there's a lot that could be done server- / api-side to make app-dev easier and make for a nicer experience.
